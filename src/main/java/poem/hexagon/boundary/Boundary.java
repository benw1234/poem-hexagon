/**
 * The boundary class is the only point of communication with left-side driver
 * adapters. It accepts commands, and calls the appropriate command handler.
 * 
 * On creation, this class wires up the dependencies between command types and
 * command handlers, by injecting the command handlers into a use case model.
 * 
 * After creation, this class sends each command it receives to the runner
 * of the use case model. The model runner then dispatches the command to the
 * appropriate command handler, which in turn calls the driven adapters.
 *
